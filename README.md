# Go
A Java implementation of the board-game "Go".
## What
This Project is a implementation of the board-game "Go", written in Java.

It show several concepts of software engineering.

* layered architecture
* observer pattern
* components and interfaces



## Why
The project was built in the context of the lecture "Software Engineering" at the University of Applied Science Konstanz, Germany.

#Documentation
See the current [Javadoc](http://michaelknoch.de/sego/doc/).

#Getting support
Feel free to contact us if you have any questions:

* [Timo Wei√ü](https://twitter.com/Timo_Weiss)

## How
If you run the application, it will initialize a simple Text-UI and Graphical-UI (as you can see below).

If the state of the game changes (eg. setting a stone in the TUI), both views will render again (Observer-Pattern).

The usage is like stealing candy from a baby.

* To set a stone to the field, just type in the choords into the command-line or click in the GUI the desired postition (eg. 55)

* The following example shows a game-situation, by which the player with the white stone can surround his opponent by setting his stone to 42

* After setting a white stone to the pos 42, the gamefield will look like as follows:

```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
0  |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

7  |0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 
8  |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
(yes, we know, the shift of the negativ numbers suck)
